## Schedule

The schedule will very likely change, but it represents the current best estimate of what topics will be covered and when.  The MIDTERM will happen the 8th week (Oct 8 or 10), and is initially scheduled for the 8th.  It may moved if need be. (I am also considering having multiple, shorter take home tests instead of an in-class Midterm).

We will update it here and post announcements on canvas when things change.

Required readings are in bold.  The listed readings are based on the Third Edition of the textbook.  See the bottom of the page for equivalent readings in other editions.

Any reading in parenthesis are recommended, and you should at least skim them to be familiar with them at a high level (in case you need that material to understand future chapters, or for an assignment).

would like to explain how to do a better job of modeling spheres
    perhaps bring in solid modeling for printing?


polyhedra, curves
surfaces, solids

volume rendering, image based
collision detection
