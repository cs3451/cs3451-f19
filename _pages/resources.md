## Resources

I will be using a variety of technology to support various parts of running this class.

We will use Github Classroom to distribute and collect assignments.  The github site is linked on the top of this page.  Github classroom takes care of creating a private repository for each student when they check out an assignment, and the TAs and Instructor will be given access.  Github is also used for this site.

Canvas will be used for posting grades, or for sharing other private content (such as the link to the discord server, below).  Most content will be shared here on github.

Piazza will be set up (via Canvas) for questions and discussion.

A OneNote Course Notebook [has been set up](https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/personal/bm110_gatech_edu/Documents/Class%20Notebooks/CS3451%20Computer%20Graphics%20Fall%202019).  The professor will use this during lecture as an electronic whiteboard, and the content will be available to the class. I will put a PDF of the slides in the notebook before class, so those who are inclined can take their own notes on the slides in their personal section of the notebook.  

A discord server has been created for more informal discussion.  We will share a link to discord on canvas (we do not want anyone not in the class to join the server).  Use of discord should follow the GT Code of Conduct.  All students who join the server are **required to set their server nickname to their full name**.  Anonymous use of discord is not permitted.

## Technology Resources

There are vast amounts of resources for Typescript on the web, starting with the documentation and examples on https://typescriptlang.org.  Also notice that Typescript is open source, and hosted at https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript. The repository has links to various resources, but also discussions galore in the issues.

Similarly, there are plenty of WebGL resources out there.  A great starting point is https://webglfundamentals.org/, which we will use in class to explore WebGL, GPU and other concepts.

If you like video, searching for Typescript or WebGL (or any other web related topic) on https://channel9.msdn.com yields a lot of different videos from over the years.

The best starting point for three.js is https://threejs.org, the main site for the library.  It is also open source, and the source for all the examples and samples are in the distribution on github.  The examples are mostly pretty simple and self contained, although poorly documented.  There are more resources if you look, though.  Josh Marinacci (GT alum, working at Mozilla) has posted a variety of tutorials on the Mozilla MR blog (in and among https://blog.mozvr.com/tag/tutorials/).
