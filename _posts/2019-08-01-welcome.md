Welcome to the Fall 2019 offering of CS3451 at Georgia Tech.  We'll be using Canvas (primarily for grades), Piazza for topic-based discussion (link in Canvas), Discord for more casual chat and discussion (invite link will be mailed to you), Github for course materials (this site, the assignments and samples).

Professor MacIntyre is primarily working off campus this semester at Mozilla, and will therefore be available through a variety of forums. He may hold the occasional office hour in VR (via [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com)).
